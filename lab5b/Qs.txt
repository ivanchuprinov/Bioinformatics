Q1 : When was structure 2g69 deposited into the PDB, and what is the author and title of the manuscript that is associated with the PDB structure?

Deposited: 2006-02-24
Authors: Liu, F., Kovalevsky, A.Y., Louis, J.M., Boross, P.I., Wang, Y.F., Harrison, R.W., Weber, I.T.
Manuscript: Mechanism of Drug Resistance Revealed by the Crystal Structure of the Unliganded HIV-1 Protease with F53L Mutation.

Q2 : What mutation (the residue, the wild type, and the mutant residue) does 2g69 exhibit?

Residue 53 mutated
Wild type residue: Phenylalanine
Mutant residue: Leucine

Q3 : What are the units of measurements in PyMOL?

Angstroms

Q4: Based on your measurement, what is the effect of the new medicine? Specify what the effect is on the structure, and what effect that has therapeutically on HIV-1 protease.

The medicine brings the flaps of the protein together. This should impede the ability of the protease to do the "cutting". This inhibits HIV-1 protease.
