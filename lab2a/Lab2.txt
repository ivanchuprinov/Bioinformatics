Q1 : What changes to the cost of the operations (insertion, deletion, replacement, etc.) would result inan edit distance for the lower alignment for SOURCE2/ Target2that is smaller than the edit distance for the upper alignment in SOURCE2/ Target2?

We can write it out as an inequality:

6i > 7i + d

When we solve for d, we get:

d < -i

If i costs 1,

d has to cost less than -1.

Q2 : What is the BLAST search ID for the alignment/job you submitted?

"An RID is like a ticket number that allows you to retrieve your search results and format them in many different ways over the next 24 hours."

Q3 : How long did the BLAST search take?

A 3-8 of seconds.

Q4: What is the organism and gene that is the best match for the query sequence?

Western chimpanzee

Q5: The 67-sequence query aligns best with what range of bases in the found (Subject) sequence?

TCTGTCCACTCCTGATGCTGTTATGGGCAACCSTAAGGTGAAGGCTCATGGCAAGAAAGTGCTCGGT

Q6 : The alignment contains how many exact nucleotide matches?

63/67 bases match

Q7 : The alignment contains how many nucleotide mismatches?

4/67 bases mismatch

Q8 : The alignment contains how many gaps in the Querysequence (be careful here ... notice the starting base number of the query sequence)?

2
